# Attending
The Interoperability Working Group meets weekly via Zoom, alternating times to better accomodate live participation from different time zones:

[Join 1400PT call *(US-friendly)*][us-zoom] |
[Meeting recordings][recordings]
 
_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group with constant new members._

_This document is live-edited DURING each call for minutes, while a stable copy lives on our [GitHub repo][repo]. Feel free to propose agenda items either via issues or by messaging on DIF Slack.
