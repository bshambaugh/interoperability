### 19th of January 2022 - EU Time
We will have a new year kickstart discussion. Revolving recent interop movements happening the last couple of months.

Preparing us for real interop for IIW 34 - April 26th-28th

Our perspective on potential interop targets:
We believe that it could be possible to have interop testing around JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+.  
We are also interested in interop around exchange protocols and seee WACI-PEX as haveing a lot of potential as the exchange protocol as it was designed to bridge between the Aries world and SVIP world.   
***Lets discuss both these proposisions.***
    

We believe test suites should be built, how?    

What is needed to get to JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ interop? Where are they bottle necks? What are the key groups that are or will be working on key parts.

#### Summary
Profile of interoperability, it has been used alot of before to land something acknowledgeble.
Profile are useful to drive interoperability to a flexible spec that can drive things forward.
WACIPex is a profile

What other profiles to others have?
German community says it is a bit complex question. Issues with BBS+ signatures as of today.
