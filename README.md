# Interoperability Project

A project to demonstrate continious technical demonstration of interoperability between DID Methods, Wallets, Agents, Encrypted Data Vaults, and Verifiable Credentials.

The project consists of a series of tools and web applications.

## [Explainer](./docs/explainer.md)

This group is primarily a "project management" group, working to educate across communities and minimize redundant or wasted work. We strive to be a welcoming place for people new to the space to get up to speed on what's happening elsewhere, as well as for insider and specialists to report out about cutting-edge development, particularly the most relevant work happening *outside* of DIF.

We keep a running bibliography of input documents [on our Notion](https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76). To suggestion additions or updates, please open a new github issue. If it is uncontroversial, we may unceremoniously close your issue after updating the notion.

Our [agenda](agenda.md) is stored here in github-- please edit it in hackmd to propose future agenda items, and/or open issues for broader agenda questions.
